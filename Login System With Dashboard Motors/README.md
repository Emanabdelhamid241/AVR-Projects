# AVR Project - Login and Dashboard for Motor Control

## Introduction

This project aims to create a login system and a dashboard for controlling motors using an AVR microcontroller. The system allows users to authenticate themselves through a login process and grants access to a dashboard where they can control connected motors.

## Features

1. **Login System**: Users are required to enter their credentials ( password) to gain access to the dashboard.

2. **Dashboard**: Once logged in, users can access the dashboard, which provides an intuitive interface for controlling the connected motors.

3. **Motor Control**: The dashboard offers options to control the connected motors, such as starting, stopping, and adjusting the speed or direction.

## Hardware Requirements

To implement this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- AVR microcontroller (ATmega32)
- Motor driver module ( L293D)
- Motor driver module ( ULN2001A)
- DC ,Stepper and Servo Motors to be controlled
- Keypad  for entering credentials
- Display module (LCD) for displaying the dashboard

## Software Requirements

The following software tools are required for developing and programming the AVR microcontroller:
- AVR development environment (Eclipse)
- Appropriate AVR programming language ( C programming language)
